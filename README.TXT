Ok, to compile, you're going to have to put MiniSuperHealth.usx in your main /StaticMeshes folder and minimegatex.utx in your /Textures folder.

After you've compiled, you are going to want to edit the super health static mesh in unrealed and change the first texture from 
minimegatex.minimega to utcompv17a.minimega so that minimegatex does not need to be distributed with the file.
